# A Vote for a supplementary rule of TOC

## Proposal
In order to improve the efficiency of feedback on TOC voting results, it is hoped to add the following supplementary clauses to the current **toc-README-Decision Making-Approvals-Lazy Consensus**.

Supplementary rule: *During the voting period, if all TOC members actively cast a +1, the voting process can be ended early and the resolution can be passed.*


## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 6 days unless there is an objection.

## Scope

TOC MEMBERS.
